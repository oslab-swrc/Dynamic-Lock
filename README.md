# Dynamic Lock

## Overview

Kernel synchronization primitives have a huge impact on some applicationsâ€™
performance and scalability. However, controlling kernel synchronization
primitives is out of reach for application developers.

This work implements a new paradigm that allows fine tune the kernel concurrency
primitives from userspace. With one-time kernel modification along with the
framework, now user can modify kernel locks on the fly without recompiling nor
reboot the whole system.

## Contents

* linux/: linux v5.4 source code with dyanmic-lock patch applied
* dynamic-lock.patch: patch applied to linux v5.4
* concord/: framework to build lock policy and livepatch moule.


## How to run
1. Prepare underlying kernel and policy program using Concord framework.
   First, make sure `./linux` directory is clean v5.4 source code.
   Then run the following script to expose APIs.

	$ cd concord
	$ python3 concord.py -v --linux_src ../linux \
		--lock lockdir/shfllock.patch \
		--policy policy/numa-grouping \
		--livepatch kpatch/patches/shfl-on-qspin.patch

2. Start VM and pin vcpu. Or you can run on the host machine with compiled linux
   kernel.

3. Send compiled policy programs(`output` directory) into the VM.

4. Inside the VM, now you can dynamically enable/disable NUMA-grouping policy.
   This repo has two example policy: numa-grouping and shuffling-off.
   numa-grouping groups threads running on a same NUMA socket, so that it works
   exactly same as shfllock.
   shuffling-off policy disables the shuffling mechanisms.

	To enable a policy, first pin eBPF program under BPFFS.


	(VM)$ sudo mount bpffs -t bpf /sys/fs/bpf
	(VM)$ sudo ./eBPFGen/<policy-name>/<policy-name>


	Then you can see the following message.


	./eBPFGen/<policy-name> loaded
	prog loaded well


	Enable the policy by inserting livepatch module.


	(VM)$ sudo insmod ./Livepatch/shfllock/livepatch-concord.ko


	Now the policy is enabled.

6. To disable the policy, run the following script.


	(VM)$ echo 0 > /sys/kernel/livepatch/livepatch_concord/enabled
	(VM)$ rm /sys/fs/bpf/*
	(VM)$ sudo rmmod livepatch_concord
